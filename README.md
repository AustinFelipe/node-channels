# node-channels

The main goal is have fun :)

Based on https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2

# Caution üôã‚õîÔ∏è

Threads on Node have specific usage. As pointed at the [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#worker_threads_worker_threads), you should use it for _performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations_. For I/O operation, libuv performs better.

# Roadmap
